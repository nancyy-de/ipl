# Upload Package for GitHub

This is a sample package you can upload to GitHub. Replace the placeholder files with your project files.

## Included files
- `index.html` — sample HTML file
- `src/main.py` — sample Python file
- `LICENSE` — MIT license
- `.gitignore` — common ignores
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Download `github_upload.zip`.
2. Unzip locally and replace the placeholder files with your project files.
3. Create a new repository on GitHub.
4. Upload the files via the GitHub web UI (Add file → Upload files) or push via git:

```bash
# Example: push to a new repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Notes
- If you want me to include specific files inside the zip, either paste their contents here or upload them and I will rebuild the zip for you.
